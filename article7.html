		<p style="font-size: 1.7rem;">Time:- Second day of the waxing moon, after the long rainy months</p>
		<p>The salt air stings my eyes as I stand on the shore before dawn, with the sea restless under the fading breath of the Cloud-laden season: I, Aravan - A pearl diver who belongs to the Prathavar community. I sink into the womb of the restless sea, a son of Korkai, where the rivers meet the salt tide, where white-lipped oysters sleep in beds of stone. Sangam poems describe the Parathavar as people <i>"who live where the sea foams"</i> and <i>"pluck white pearls from the sea’s dark throat.”</i> Our kin rise early to prepare themselves for the early dawn preparation like off ering prayers to Varuna, get ready with the tools like stone weights, Nose clips, and earplugs, Shell or net baskets, ropes, and get the boat ready. Before departure from home, my mother used to make me kanji, which is a mixture of rice gruel and salt or tamarind, accompanied by a sip of palm toddy. At fi rst light, my companions and I gather by the shore, seeking the stillness of the sea before the winds rise. In those quiet moments, the water holds its breath, and so do we. Today, a Roman ship is anchored at the harbour, its white, blatant sail glowing in the morning light. The Roman merchants speak in a tongue none of us understands - strange, sharp tones as if small pebbles tumbled in their mouths. Clad themselves in thick, draped cloth, unlike us, heavier and dyed in bright colours I have never seen before. One wore a belt with silver rings; another carried a scroll sealed with wax.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Korkai, my home, lies where the Tamiraparani River meets the roaring sea, its waters dark with silt and stories. Here, the land is red and wet, and the breath of the ocean rules the lives of all. Korkai is not just a village; it is the ocean’s gift to us. It's tides that feed our lives. I dive for pearls, but many others fi nd their living here: fi shermen casting nets, families making salt, traders loading boats. The old men of our village speak of Korkai’s past. They say that once Korkai was the seat of three great brothers - Cholan, Cheran, and Pandyan, who ruled together from here, but due to diff erences, they parted ways. The Pandyan remained, keeping Korkai as his capital.</p>
		<p>My hands are tough from rope and salt. Each morning, I tie a stone to my waist to sink fast, wear a turtle-shell nose clip, and plug my ears with beeswax. A palm basket hangs at my side for oysters, and a rope around my chest, which is held by my companion on the boat. One tug means I’m safe. Two means pull me up. If there’s no signal… he knows. Sometimes I carry a shell knife, but mostly it’s just my hands, the sea, and a silent prayer. They say not all of us dive for family or hunger. Some were sent here in chains, tied to the same ropes we trust our lives with. The king’s men bring them from inland—men who stole, killed, or disobeyed. Instead of iron bars, they are given a stone weight and a basket, told to earn their place by facing the dangers of the ocean. I’ve seen them - eyes hollow, backs bent, diving with more fear than skill. Some never return. The sea keeps them, and no one asks for their names. I don’t know if it’s mercy or cruelty, what the Pandyan lords have chosen. But here in Korkai, the sea judges all of us the same, whether born to the shore or dragged here by fate.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We all live by the shores, but not all of us stand on the same ground. We pearl divers are mostly Parathavar, known for our skills and courage. Then there are lines of fi shermen who carry their small boats off the shore and bring back fi sh, prawns, and crabs. Then the saltmakers, which is mostly carried out by women who struggle in the hot sun for days, gathering salt from heaps of salt pans. Women in Korkai keep everything steady while we take oysters from the sea to our home. We dive, yes—but they wait, they sort, they carry more than we do sometimes. Some women here trade. Some stitch nets. Some run whole households when the men don’t return from the sea. And no one speaks it loudly, but when one of us is taken by the waves, it’s the women who hold the family together like a net that doesn’t snap.</p>
		<p>They call our sea rich for the pearls we bring up from its depths. Every morning, we dive and haul oysters; the king’s men take the best pearls for the Pandya treasury. The rest go to traders—some from far-off lands I can’t even name. They come with gold, wine, even strange coins, just for a piece of what we pull from the sea. Once ashore, the oysters rot in heaps, then we crack them open, one by one. Most hold nothing. But when we fi nd one with that pale glow, we know it’s worth something. They’re sorted by size, color, and shine—some are taken, some sold. Korkai lives on these pearls. Temples rise, streets fi ll, and the markets stay busy. We dive, they trade, and the world turns. I don't wear pearls. But I know their weight—on my back, in my lungs, and in the hands that reach across the sea to buy them.</p>
		<p>The realm of the Pandyan kings extends majestically from the towering hills in the west to the shimmering sea in the east. The variyars are the ones who collect taxes on behalf of the Pandyan king. They usually have a record on palm leaves. Land tax serves as a vital revenue stream, primarily contributed by farmers. Typically, they pay one-sixth of their harvest to the king's granaries. We pearl divers are taxed too. Pandya king claimed the best pearls, and offi cials oversaw the collection. We kept the rest, sold them in the markets.</p>
		<p>When the seas grow wild and the sky no longer stays clear, we stop diving. The waters won’t forgive a man who tests them in the wrong season. Many of us take other work for a living, like salt making, net weaving, and trading under merchants. Many head inland seeking opportunities to work with farmers during the harvest season, where extra hands are not only welcomed but vital to a bountiful yield.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I’m no fine poet like the ones they praise in Madurai, but I know my land, my sea, and the life we live. Here in Korkai, the capital of the Pandya kingdom, we dive deep for pearls that travel farther than we ever will. The king’s emblem is the twin fi sh, and it suits him well, ruler of rivers and sea alike. His reach keeps our coast safe and our markets full of voices from distant lands. Tomorrow, we dive again. For now, I let the salt stay on my skin and close my eyes.</p>
